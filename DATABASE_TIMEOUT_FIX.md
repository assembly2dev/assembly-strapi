# Database Timeout Fix - KnexTimeoutError Solution

## Problem
You're experiencing `KnexTimeoutError: Knex: Timeout acquiring a connection. The pool is probably full.` This happens when the database connection pool is exhausted.

## Root Cause
Your current `.env` configuration has very conservative pool settings:
- `DATABASE_POOL_MAX=3` (too small for your application's needs)
- `DATABASE_ACQUIRE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=30000` (30 seconds - too short)

## Solution

### 1. Update Your .env File
Replace your current database pool settings with these optimized values:

```bash
# OPTIMIZED Connection Pool Settings - FIXED FOR TIMEOUT ISSUES
DATABASE_POOL_MIN=2
DATABASE_POOL_MAX=8
DATABASE_ACQUIRE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=60000
DATABASE_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT=60000
DATABASE_CREATE_TIMEOUT=30000
DATABASE_DESTROY_TIMEOUT=5000
DATABASE_IDLE_TIMEOUT=30000
DATABASE_REAP_INTERVAL=1000
DATABASE_CREATE_RETRY_INTERVAL=200
DATABASE_DEBUG=true
```

### 2. Key Changes Made:
- **Increased Pool Size**: `DATABASE_POOL_MAX=8` (from 3) to handle more concurrent connections
- **Increased Timeouts**: `DATABASE_ACQUIRE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=60000` (60 seconds) to give more time for connection acquisition
- **Enabled Debug**: `DATABASE_DEBUG=true` to help monitor connection usage
- **Optimized Pool Management**: Better idle timeout and retry intervals

### 3. Apply the Fix
1. Update your `.env` file with the new settings above
2. Restart your Strapi application:
   ```bash
   npm run develop
   ```

### 4. Monitor the Fix
With `DATABASE_DEBUG=true`, you'll see connection pool activity in your logs. Look for:
- Connection acquisition messages
- Pool exhaustion warnings
- Connection release confirmations

### 5. If Issues Persist
If you still experience timeouts, you can further increase:
- `DATABASE_POOL_MAX=10` (maximum recommended for most applications)
- `DATABASE_ACQUIRE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=90000` (90 seconds)

## Why This Happens
Your application has extensive database operations:
- Authentication system with session management
- User logging and audit trails
- Token management
- Rate limiting checks
- Multiple concurrent API requests

The small pool size (3 connections) couldn't handle the concurrent load, causing the timeout error.

## Prevention
- Monitor your application's database usage patterns
- Consider implementing connection pooling at the application level for high-traffic scenarios
- Use database monitoring tools to track connection usage
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic for database operations

## Testing the Fix
After applying the changes, test your application with:
1. Multiple concurrent login attempts
2. High-frequency API requests
3. Background cron jobs (session cleanup, etc.)

The timeout errors should be resolved with these optimized settings.
